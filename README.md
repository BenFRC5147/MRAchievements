# Marvel Rivals Achievements Tracker 🚀  

This is my **first-ever React app**, built to track and manage Marvel Rivals achievements across different categories. I used **AI assistance** to help me develop this project, improving my understanding of **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS** while building a functional and responsive web application.
